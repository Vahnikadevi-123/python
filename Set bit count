##If a number is represented in it's binary form, count the no of 1's in it and print them.


#Converting into binary and finiding no of 1's:

n=int(input())
s=bin(n)
c=0
for i in s[2:]:
    if i=='1':
        c+=1
print(c)


#In mathematical way:

n=int(input())
count=0
while n:
    if n%2!=0:
        count+=1
    n=n//2
print(count)


#Using Bitwise AND:
