##Creating a matrix by taking 1st row and 1st column as 1's an dprinting the last element of the matrix:

m=int(input())
n=int(input())
arr=[[0 for i in range(n)]for j in range(m)]
for i in range(m):
    for j in range(n):
        if i==0 or j==0:
            arr[i][j]=1
        else:
            arr[i][j]=arr[i-1][j]+arr[i][j-1]
print(arr[m-1][n-1])
