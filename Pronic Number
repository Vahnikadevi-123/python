## If a number is equal to the product of two consecutove nuimbers 56then yhe number is called as "PRONIC NUMBER"
   Example---> 56 == 7*8  Hence it is a pronic number


from math import sqrt
def is_pronic(n):
    a=int(sqrt(n))
    if a*(a+1)==n:
        return "Pronic Number"
    return "Not a pronic number"
n=int(input())
print(is_pronic(n))
