## If a number n is concatinated with n+1, and if the resultant number is a perfect square the the number is called as SASTRY NUMBER.
   Example: 183
            sqrt(183184) is a perfect square. Hence it is a sastry number


from math import sqrt
def is_sastry(n):
    n1=n+1
    a=str(n)+str(n1)
    b=int(a)
    if sqrt(b)==int(sqrt(b)):
        return "Yes"
    return "No"
n=int(input())
print(is_sastry(n))
